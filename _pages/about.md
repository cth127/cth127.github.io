I’m Taehun Cha, a Ph.D. candidate in AIML. While in undergraduate school, I majored in Sociology, Cultural study, and Applied Statistics. Though I currently do not utilize most of the knowledge I learned at that time, I learned how to think, write, and communicate with people from totally different backgrounds.

After graduation, I needed to find a way to manage my livelihood. So I learned financial engineering and was certificated as an International Financial Risk Manager. Though I currently do not utilize most of the knowledge I learned at that time (again), my curiosity about modern language models ignited at that time. Also, I’m still interested in AI applications in the financial domain.

Now I’m learning mathematics to explain the several common behaviors of LLMs rigorously. Though digging LLMs from a mathematical aspect is yet immature and challenging, I believe we, humans, need to understand how and why this works clearly, before it is adopted too deeply into our lives.
