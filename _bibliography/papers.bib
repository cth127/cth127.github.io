    abstract = "In this work, we investigate the emergence of linear separability for unseen data points in the high-dimensional last-layer feature space of deep neural networks. Through empirical analysis, we observe that, after training, in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples become linearly separable in the last-layer feature space when the hidden dimension is sufficiently highâ€”even in regimes where the input data itself is not. We leverage these observations for the task of uncertainty quantification. By connecting our findings to classical support vector machine margin theory, we theoretically show that the separating hyperplane exhibits a higher weight norm when facing in-distribution data points. This work highlights linear separability as a fundamental and analyzable property of trained deep neural networks' representations, offering a geometric perspective on the practical uncertainty quantification task in neural networks."

    abstract = "In causal inference, a randomized experiment is a de facto method to overcome various theoretical issues in observational study. However, the experimental design requires expensive costs, so an efficient experimental design is necessary. We propose ABC3, a Bayesian active learning policy for causal inference. We show a policy minimizing an estimation error on conditional average treatment effect is equivalent to minimizing an integrated posterior variance, similar to Cohn criteria. We theoretically prove ABC3 also minimizes an imbalance between the treatment and control groups and the type 1 error probability. Imbalance-minimizing characteristic is especially notable as several works have emphasized the importance of achieving balance. Through extensive experiments on real-world data sets, ABC3 achieves the highest efficiency, while empirically showing the theoretical results hold."

By examining 24 models on 6 data sets, we find out that 88-98{\%} of cases return statistically significantly distinguishable generation probability and uncertainty distributions. Using this general phenomenon, we showcase a hallucination-reducing training algorithm. Our algorithm outperforms other baselines by achieving higher faithfulness metrics while maintaining sound general text quality measures.",

The current success of large language models demonstrates the LLM{'}s extrapolation ability to several unseen tasks. In line with these works, we evaluate the LLM{''}s extrapolation ability in the chemical domain. We construct a data set measuring the material properties of epoxy polymers depending on various raw materials and curing processes. LLM should predict the material property when novel raw material is introduced utilizing its chemical knowledge. Through experiments, LLM tends to choose the right direction of adjustment but fails to determine the exact degree, resulting in poor MAE on some properties. But LLM can successfully adjust the degree with only a one-shot example. The results show that LLM can extrapolate to new unseen material utilizing its chemical knowledge learned through massive pre-training.",

On the other hand, two words can convey similar meanings given a homogeneous context. As a result, considering only word spelling information is not sufficient to obtain quality text representation. We propose SentenceLDA, a sentence-level topic model. We combine modern SentenceBERT and classical LDA to extend the semantic unit from word to sentence. By extending the semantic unit, we verify that SentenceLDA returns more discriminative document representation than other topic models, while maintaining LDA{'}s elegant probabilistic interpretability. We also verify the robustness of SentenceLDA by comparing the inference results on original and paraphrased texts. Additionally, we implement one possible application of SentenceLDA on corpus-level key opinion mining by applying SentenceLDA on an argumentative corpus, DebateSum.",

Our model, N-EPT, solves Noun-MWPs significantly better than other models, and at the same time, solves conventional MWPs as well. Solving Noun-MWPs may lead to bridging MWP solvers and traditional question-answering NLP models.",
